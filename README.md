# AuthenticationSystem
# Authentication System PHP Script

## Overview
This repository contains a PHP script for an authentication system. The script allows users to enter their details including age and validates whether they are at least 18 years old. It provides actions such as validation and error handling.

## What has been done?
- installation of laravel via terminal
- installation of docker & composer
  
1. Users register their account by filling in their details including their age in a web form.
2. The PHP script validates the name input:
   - Entering name is empty
3. The script validates the password input:
   - Entering password is empty
   - Password is
5. The script validates the age input:
   - Checks if it's empty.
   - Verifies if it's a positive number.
   - Ensures the age is at least 18 years.
6. If the age is valid, it can be further processed (not included in this example).
7. If the age is not valid, an error message is displayed to the user.

8. Users logging in their account entering username and password
9. The PHP script validates the name input:
    - Entering username is empty
    - Username exists
    - password is valid and exists
  
## How long did it take?
It took too long to install tools such as laravel as I was not familiar with for example laravel, composer and react. Once I thought I installed whatever was needed, I started working on my coding. I do have basic HTML and JavaScript experience, however, not much on PHP and laravel. Creating the login and registration code was slightly more easy than the validation of the age, which is still not working 100%, as well as running the program with the build in server of VS.
